# Motor.js

Motor.js is an HTML game engine.

## Status

Not very far along really. I doubt you would want to use it right now.

## What's the point

There are loads of javascript game engines. I made this one because I am on an ego trip.

## What does it do

It includes little libraries for simplifying: events, dom manipulation, running loops, prototypical inheritance, touch input. It uses [require.js](http://requirejs.org/) too. Hopefully it makes all your shit easier.
